# 🍽️ Simple Canteen — Core JS Exercise

A tiny client-side canteen demo app that demonstrates basic form controls, filtering, sorting and a simple tray/cart — built with plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## ✨ Features
- Filter items by category (All / Meals / Snacks / Drinks) 🗂️  
- Sort items by price (ascending / descending) ↕️  
- Add items to a tray and view the running total 🧾  
- Clear tray or reset filters with simple controls ♻️

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open the file `index.html` in your browser (no server required). ▶️

## 🧭 How to use
- Select a category and sort option from the dropdowns.
- Click "Apply" to filter/sort the menu.
- Click "Reset" to clear filters.
- Add items to the tray from the menu; the tray list and total will update.
- Use "Clear Tray" to empty the tray.

## 🛠️ Files to edit
- `app.js` — main JavaScript logic (filtering, sorting, tray management)  
- `styles.css` — styling and layout  
- `index.html` — structure and UI
